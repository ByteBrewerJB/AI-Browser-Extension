# AI Browser Extension Architecture & Roadmap

## Overview
This Chrome/Edge extension augments ChatGPT with richer conversation management, audio tooling, and workflow automation. It ships as a Manifest V3 project compiled with TypeScript and React, bundled by Vite, and persists data with the browser `storage` APIs plus optional cloud sync later.

## Target Surfaces
- **Content script** injected into chat.openai.com to add UI affordances and capture data streams.
- **Popup** for quick actions (bookmarks, pinned prompts, active chat metrics).
- **Options / dashboard page** for full management: chat archive, GPTs, prompt chains, bulk actions, exports.
- **Background service worker** to centralize storage sync, schedule backups, and broker audio downloads.
- **Side panel (optional)** leveraging the Chrome side panel API for persistent workspace tools.
- **Inline quick settings tray (planned)** embedded next to the ChatGPT composer for quick toggles and filters.

## Tech Stack
- TypeScript + React 18 UI components.
- Tailwind CSS for rapid styling with RTL/LTR utilities.
- Vite + `@crxjs/vite-plugin` to emit MV3 artifacts.
- Zustand for lightweight app state shared between surfaces.
- IndexedDB (via Dexie) for structured, offline-first data. Mirror critical metadata into `chrome.storage.sync` for multi-device sync.
- Web Speech API / `chrome.tts` for advanced voice playback; `MediaRecorder` for capture when available.
- WebAssembly-enabled audio processor (phase 2) to support advanced voice mode features such as pitch shifting.

## High-Level Modules
- **core/storage**: abstraction over IndexedDB + storage.sync mirroring + conflict resolution.
- **core/models**: schemas for conversations, messages, prompts, GPT configs, bookmarks.
- **core/services**: audio pipeline, export service (TXT/JSON), search index builder, sync orchestrator.
- **ui/components**: shared React building blocks with RTL/LTR awareness and multilingual copy support via i18next.
- **features/** grouped by domain (conversations, prompts, GPTs, audio, search).
- **background/** service worker entry orchestrating alarms, context menus, download handling.
- **content/** script enhancements interacting with ChatGPT DOM.

## Data & Sync Strategy
- Primary store: IndexedDB tables (`conversations`, `messages`, `gpts`, `prompts`, `folders`, `settings`).
- Change tracking: per-record `updatedAt` timestamps + event log for reconciliation.
- Sync tiers:
  1. Browser-level sync using `chrome.storage.sync` for metadata (names, ids, timestamps) to enable multi-device awareness.
  2. Optional encrypted backup to user-selected provider (future enhancement) to fully share message bodies.
- Metadata sync pipeline: conversation mutations trigger `syncBridge` updates (`src/core/storage/conversations.ts`), keeping counts/pin/archive state mirrored remotely.
- Search: build incremental index using MiniSearch stored in IndexedDB, refreshed per change batch.

## Accessibility & Localization
- All UI surfaces respect keyboard navigation, high-contrast mode, and screen-reader labels.
- `i18next` with JSON locale bundles, defaulting to English and supporting dynamic language switching.
- Text direction toggled globally; layout components read from `dir` state.

## Roadmap 2.0 Overview
Roadmap 2.0 reframes delivery into nine phases (0–8) that highlight architectural scope, reusable deliverables, and the effort required to unlock future capabilities. Earlier milestones such as Dexie-backed storage and the prompt management suite are now treated as reusable foundations instead of active projects.

- **Observability & telemetry**: Instrument key flows (capture latency, sync queue depth, search responsiveness) with privacy-conscious logging. Establish weekly dashboards that feed into Phase 8 scorecards.
- **Accessibility & localization**: Maintain WCAG compliance and EN/NL parity; set quarterly audits scoring keyboard coverage, ARIA labelling, and translation completeness.
- **Security & privacy reviews**: Introduce checklist for new data flows, referencing sync, audio, and intelligence ADRs to ensure encryption, opt-in toggles, and data lifecycle policies remain current.
- **Documentation hygiene**: Keep roadmap/feature plan in lockstep; record architectural decisions as ADRs before implementation begins for phases 3+, ensuring contributors have traceable context.

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Storage contention**: Chrome `storage.sync` quota limitations could throttle sync. Mitigate by batching updates, compressing payloads, and allowing users to opt into reduced-sync mode.
- **DOM churn on ChatGPT**: upstream markup changes may break content capture. Maintain selector guards, feature flags, and a detection health monitor with telemetry hooks.
- **Performance regressions**: large histories and MiniSearch indexing can degrade UX. Adopt virtualization, worker-based indexing, and incremental sync strategies early.
- **Privacy considerations**: backups and voice features handle sensitive data. Enforce opt-in flows, encryption at rest for backups, and clear documentation of what is stored.

## Documentation & Communication Plan
- Update this roadmap at the close of each milestone with accomplishments, blockers, and adjustments.
- Mirror implementation details into `docs/feature-plan.md` and create decision records for non-trivial architectural choices.
- Publish contributor onboarding notes covering storage schema, messaging contracts, and testing expectations.
